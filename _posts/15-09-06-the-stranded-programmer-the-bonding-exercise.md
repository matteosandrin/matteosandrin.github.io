title: The Stranded Programmer • The Bonding Exercise
---

__Week 1 • Day 7__

### 1. Adapting To The Environment
I think I'm starting to get into the rythm of the school, I feel more within than without, and the people are starting to grow on me.  
Today we had to produce and act a play based on a fairytale, which was all executed in roughly twenty-four hours and, in my opinion, was a great [Bonding Exercise](/2015/09/06/the-stranded-programmer-the-bonding-exercise/). The dorm now feels more unite than ever and people are starting to make lasting friendships. Trapelo was more artsy though, so they won the stick.
### 2. The People
Now I'll have a run down of all the people I remember here, just as a reminder for the future, when I'll eventually forget them all:  

##### 2.1 Marisa • 2017
Marisa is somewhat a riddle; she's very challenging to talk to, and I guess for some reason I think of that as a good character trait instead of a flaw. She appears very confident but I suspect that could be just a façade for a mushy inside. Not weak, just a bit mushy.  
Furthermore, she's very smart and witty, and makes no excuse for it. The fact that she's very open about changes in her character may signify that she's trying to believe what she says herself while trying to make others believe it.
Did I say sh's kinda pretty?

##### 2.2 Benjamin • 2019
Ben is a mildly aware person, but just lacks the expertise in life that defines the spine of a person. As an example, he's third-wheeling Emilia and Dario, maybe without even knowing it. Right know he's talking to some girl for Dario, it's a bit weird. He has potential though; today, during the play, I noticed that he's well liked and respected, and he was actually kinda good acting, so I keep my hopes up.  
That bowlish haircut has to go though, I can't stand it.

##### 2.3 Jiamin • 2018
Jiamin was really friendly at first, an obligation for Dorm Leaders, but he's a cool guy. He has a weird reverence for me, which is a result of his idea that I am the representation of the western idea of handsome. The same goes for Cho. It's a peculiar thing, I'll have to look into it.

##### 2.4 Dario • 2018
Dario is Mexican dude tht looks like he's stright from the cartel. I don't think he's stupid, but certainly not smart. He has this latino sex appeal on him that Emilia seems to pick up on, even though rumor has it that he doesn't actually like her, and he's doing this just to help Ben, even though I personally think it's total bullshit.

##### 2.5 Miriam • 2019
Miriam is a sweet sweet girl, she got me cookies and refused to have me pay for them. I'm afraid she has a bit of a crush on me but unfortunately she's just not my type. This is not creating problems right now but it may do in the future. This is actually a really shit situation. 
Malik keeps bugging me about it, but he doesn't understand how frustrating this is for me, so he keeps pushing.



**I'm tired now, so I think I'll complete this list another time.**
