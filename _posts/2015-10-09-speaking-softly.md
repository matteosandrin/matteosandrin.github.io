__Week 6 • Day 40__

### 1. The Crunch

This week I have more caffeine than blood in my veins. I am just now recovering from a series of late night writing sessions for my classes. I am exhausted but alert. I am within and without. The curtain has closed, the day is done and all is well. No more homework for a few days, just relaxing and catching up on the people I've been neglecting.

### 2. The Talk

Doesn't it feel good to take things off your chest. This one had been rumbling for a while inside so I'm quite happy it did. It was very earnest. I spoke in a slightly unstable way. She responded softly. You're getting closer. Just a moment adn I'm back in the night, happy and confused.

### 3. The Soup

I had a very large vietnamese Pho soup. It was spicy. It was great. It's now making its way through my insides wobbling left and right. I had my nail done in a chinese shop, first manicure of my life. Great feeling. My nails are so shiny. Will be back for the French version.  
  
Evrerythng is confused, but it's on its way to being where I'd like it to.
