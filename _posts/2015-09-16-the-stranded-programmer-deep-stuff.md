__Week 3 • Day 17__

### 1. A Green Living Room
I'm sitting on a green sofa, in a green living room, surrounded by green carpetry that runs up to two green doors. This is the Aleph dorm, in all its beauty.

It's actually a really cozy living space, while retaining a good deal of modernism, thanks to those floor to ceiling windows. The air is getting chilly, and frankly I don't even mind it, it's been hot for too long. While I have lots of friend here, I find a deep connection just with one person... I don't know if I'm supposed to be sad that I have so few or grateful that I have this one.

### 2. Race, Identity and Gender

Two thing I had never experienced before coming here are debates over race and identity.  
The first one I encountered during my A Block, an english calss called "Harlem Renaissance". Our teacher teches this class very passionately, and she showed me some issues which are peculiar to America.  
For example people here care if you're black but "act white", which was very interesting for me, because Italy is a very homogenous place and therefore doesn't have these clash of cultures, which instead are common place in such a diverse place as the United States.  
Secondly, I recently had a very peculiar converstaion with a very bright girl about personal identity. She said sometimes people called her out on her not being really "latino" because she does not fluently speak spanish, even though she does have cuban heritage. This issue had never occurred to me, because I am very rooted in my Italian identity, I live the language, I live the lifestyle, I live the food, but here people have to make a real effort to make other people consider them as a certain person and not what they think they should be. I had a comparable experience with gender; here on campus there are plenty of people who don't feel like the gender they were born with and just decide to change either pronouns, name or both, and I it's the first time in my life I confront myself with this. I feel this encounter with people different from me is very beneficial to wideneing my acceptance of others, and I feel more liberated.
