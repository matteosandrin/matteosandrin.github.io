title: Visualizing High School Students
---

This graph shows every student attending my high school, divided by graduation class and by Mod ( e.g. semester ), connected together by the classes they have taken together. When you hover over a name, each connection binds two people who took a class at the same time, making for a very pleasing visual effect.

This graph instead shows the distribution of my high school's classes, on the basis of the number of classes per department over the whole year. It's very interesting how the department with most classes is English, which is most likely a result of the four-credit English yearly requirement.

This graph shows the distribution of my high school's classes by department, on the basis on the total sum of class sizes, which gives an indication of their teaching volume and therefore of how much resources they need.

I made these graphs to learn more about the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library, to delve into graph theory, and most importantly beacuse I like pretty visuals.

*P.S. It does not work well at all on mobile devices.*
