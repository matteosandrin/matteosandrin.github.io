__Week 5 • Day 35__

### 1. Records and Chill

The sacred ritual of Records and Chill has now officially been recognized as a tradition. Me, Emilee and Marisa meet up to listen to the soothing sound of her mellow records, and just talk about life and everything that's happening to *us*. Often there are more people, drifing in and out, eavsdropping the music from the hall, but we are the fixture, the triad. There's a flickering reflection on the wall coming from the spinning record, it reminds me of a song stuck in my head. We talk. The Oregon mass shooting comes up. We're all sad now, but the coversation is still interesting. I stay for a moment too long on two bright eyes, and they notice. It's 11:55. I slide the silky sleeves of my coat up to my shoulders and feel the fabric hugging me. One last look, before I find myself in the night, alone and happy.

### 2. Trippin' Burgers

I signed up for the Harvard Square trip. The bus is really cozy. The trio is all there.  
We drift around like leaves in the unforgiving New England wind. I have the first real food in weeks. So tasty and rich. Somehow we end up in a record store, and every thing seems to make sense. The smell of old paper, the texture of the grooves, I feel at home. I make my may through the eras of jazz and rock, spotting here and there familiar titles. The underground is not quite packed, not quite empty, cleaner than I expected. I'm sleeping during the ride back, thinking. We watch a movie in the black box. The Departed. Radio silence. A missed oportunity. I head back into the night, alone and dying.

### 3. The Foodie Foodie Organ

I'm going to have acual good food today. I'm so excited. Food is *really* important in my life after all. There's a buffet of assorted asian food. *All you can eat*. I love you america and your overestimation of people's eating habits. I get back to my dear balck box. Record podcast. Done. Emilee is dying Vanessa's hair down at the Barn. I can't possibly miss that. Marisa's back. Records and chill with the crew, eyes making me warm. I head back into the night, but I'm not alone anymore.
