### 1. The Preface

At 11:30 I'm at Linate airport.  
Deserted.  
At 14:30 I'm in Dublin ( actually 13:30, different time zone ).  
There's some confusion at the flight connections desk, but this place also feels deserted.  
American customs are a breeze, after all an F1 visa has got to count for something.  

My flight companion is Italian, but obviously going to study abroad, from what I can gather from a peek at his desktop he's a mix of engeneering and sociology major, ther's a paper open about bullism.  
Peculiar.
Audrey keeps me company with her *Cat*, the flight is a just brief limbo between lives.

Boston doesn't initially strike me as a beautiful city, kind of gritty for me.  
I could be awfully stressed or not, I can't tell if I'm faking being calm or freaking he fuck out.
I pass through this city taking snapshots, but it doesn't really pass through me, it feels stale.

The narrator on the ferry has a sweet and bubbly voice though, so that's nice.

### 2. The Introduction

The drive up is very silent.  
Not a very good sign. In any case.  
Focus focus focus you loved this place when you visited, don't be *unreasonable*. 
 
Unpacking is dreadful, like picking apart a dead animal. 
Everyone is impossibly nice, doesn't feel right.  
Always hated icebreakers, but now they *really* seem to make a difference.
It may be selfish, but the fact that my parents are still here unnerves me. For some reason.  

The hierarchy is strict, but it pretends not to be, with the Dorm Leaders as foot soldiers of an army controlling its own people.  
I wave to a white car disappearing in the lot.  
I turn my back.  
So it begins.

### 3. The First Characters

As I said, people are unnervingly nice here.   
This morning I had a session of talking about *my physical, mental and emotional condition* as an *international* student.  
Whatever that means.  
We'll see it in action, most definitely.  
Still unnerving. And eerie.  

Had a very nice walk up a hill. Talked with interesting people.  
One in particular. We'll see about her as well.  
It feels like there's a kind of tacit acknowledgment. Kinda beautiful if you ask me.  


### 4. Finally, The Plot Thickens

Tonight I had a very nice dinner and actually enjoyed conversation.  
There's some witty banter going around, not quite flirting, but almost.  
Those big eyes are watching me.  
I don't mind though, I like being watched.  


The evening was uneventful, but bonding.  
We feel more like a community now.  
This is has potential.  
I think I could be happy here.
