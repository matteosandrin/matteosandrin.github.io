title: Visualizing Students By Shared Classes
---

This interactive graph shows every student attending my high school, divided by graduation class and by Mod ( e.g. semester ), connected together by the classes they have taken together. When you hover over a name, each connection binds two people who took a class at the same time, making for a very pleasing visual effect.

I made this graph to learn more about the [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library, to delve into graph theory, and most importantly beacuse I like pretty visuals.

*P.S. It does not work well at all on mobile devices.*
