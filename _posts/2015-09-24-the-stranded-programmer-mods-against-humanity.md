__Week 4 • Day 25__

### 1. Mid-life Crysis
This was a depressing morning. To start off in a good mood, I talked to Samantha and gained nothing by that conversation. I mean words were coming out of her mouth and made sense, but I didn't feel I had gained any insight by that. Maybe I'm getting slow and it just slipped by me. Still, it's frustrating. I will have to get better in the second essay, or things could take a dark turn.  

### 2. Barbies & Kens
I can't keep up any more with all the fakeness. All the eerie "How are you doing?" and "How's your day going?" from people that don't actually care is getting to me, I can't stand it. And it's worse. Because this virus is very rooted in the campus, after a while I start to doubt even the people I thought to actually care, and it gives me an uneasy feeling of distance. This usually wears off during the next trip out together, or afternoon spent loitering somewhere while [Netflix and chilling](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=netflix+and+chill&defid=8363536) ( not actually, but it's become an inside joke now ). When this sort of thing happens, the gloom fades away in the face of real experiences and emotions shared, which cannot be denied. But it's always there, lurking in the dark, ready to grapple on when I'm alone.

### 3. Oh, the Humanity!
Today I played a game called [Cards Against Humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cards_Against_Humanity) in which the objective is to find the most hilarious / offensive / politically incorrect way to fill in a blank in a sentence, and they who succeed in this goal win the round. I had already played it before, but it was a very fun hour and a half nevertheless. The game is fairly offensive to all people including white / black / jewish / muslim / fat and encompassing themes such as gore / sex / weird references to movies / holocaust / killing / babies. It really is a multi-faceted show of humanity.
