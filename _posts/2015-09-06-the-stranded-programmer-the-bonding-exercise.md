title: The Stranded Programmer • The Bonding Exercise
---

__Week 1 • Day 7__

### 1. Adapting To The Environment
I think I'm starting to get into the rythm of the school, I feel more within than without, and the people are starting to grow on me.  
Today we had to produce and act a play based on a fairytale, which was all executed in roughly twenty-four hours and, in my opinion, was a great [Bonding Exercise](/2015/09/06/the-stranded-programmer-the-bonding-exercise/). The dorm now feels more unite than ever and people are starting to make lasting friendships. Trapelo was more artsy though, so they won the stick.
### 2. The People
Now I'll have a run down of all the people I remember here, just as a reminder for the future, when I'll eventually forget them all:  

##### 2.1 Marisa • 2017
Marisa is somewhat a riddle; she's very challenging to talk to, and I guess for some reason I think of that as a good character trait instead of a flaw. She appears very confident. Is that just a façade?.
Furthermore, she's very smart and witty, and makes no excuse for it. The fact that she's very open about changes in her character may signify that she's trying to believe what she says herself while trying to make others believe it. But I don't really know her enough to judge right now.

##### 2.2 Benjamin • 2019
Ben is a mildly aware person, but just lacks the expertise in life. As an example, he's third-wheeling Emilia and Dario, maybe without even knowing it.  He has potential though; today, during the play, I noticed that he's well liked and respected, and he was actually kinda good acting, so I keep my hopes up.  
That bowlish haircut has to go though, I can't stand it.

##### 2.4 Dario • 2018
Dario is Mexican dude tht looks like he's stright from the cartel. I don't think he's stupid, but he doesn't make a show of it. He has this latino sex appeal on him that Emilia seems to pick up on. That hair though, I don't like it.

##### 2.5 Miriam • 2019
Miriam is a sweet sweet girl, she got me cookies and refused to have me pay for them. I'm afraid she has a bit of a crush on me but unfortunately she's just not my type. This is not creating problems right now but it may do in the future. Or maybe I'm just a bit too self-cenetered and this is all in my head



**I'm tired now, so I think I'll complete this list another time.**
