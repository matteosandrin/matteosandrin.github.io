This project is meant to be a *repository* for both my `code` and my thoughts on life, death and traveling, hence the name of the blog, [LIVE+CODE](/).

I am an Italian programmer, based in Milan; however, I will be spending the end of 2015 and the better part of 2016 in Boston, MA.

If you'd like to get in contact, shoot me an email at [matteo.sandrin@hotmail.it](mailto:matteo.sandrin@hotmail.it) or look me up on [GitHub](https://github.com/SandPhoenix).
